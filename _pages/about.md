#### Hi there 👋
---
I am Sayed Nadim.

I am originally from Bangladesh 🇧🇩 and currently working as a researcher in South Korea. Thank you for visiting my profile! Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or just have a chat. 😊

#### 🌱 What Do I Do
💂‍♂️ I am a computer vision researcher with experience in developing cutting-edge AI-based solutions and a passionate developer who loves to explore new technologies and build innovative projects.

🏗️ I have 6+ years of experience in designing traditional/deep learning methods for 2D & 3D image processing techniques, utilizing supervised/semi-supervised/unsupervised learning, working with different sensors (RGB pinhole/wideangle/Fisheye cameras, Monochrome cameras, NIR/LWIR cameras, Neuromorphic sensors, LiDAR, IMU, etc.), and deep generative vision models.


#### 🌱 What I'm Working On
🔭 I’m currently working on in-cabin algorithms and monocular depth estimation.

🤔: I'm also trying to find a way to have a better convolution mechanism (this is above my current knowledge but I am digging deeper)

💻: I usually work with PyTorch with some C++.  

#### 👯 Looking to Collaborate On
- Open source projects that make a difference.
- Innovative ideas that can solve real-world problems.


#### 🌱 Education
- Master's from the Department of IT Convergence Engineering (2019-2021) from Gachon University, under the supervision of  Prof. Yong Ju Jung. 
  - Applied research in depth, generative vision solutions, low-level vision, and sensor calibration.
- Undergraduate studies from the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (2013-2017), under the supervision of Dr. S. M. Mahbubur Rahman.
