**Intro**
Hi, I am Sayed Nadim, an AI researcher. I build perception systems that actually work. My focus is engineering AI systems that don’t collapse under real-world pressure.

**Summary**
Computer vision expert with a focus on practical, high-impact AI for autonomous systems. I work in R\&D, deliver PoCs/MVPs that don’t just demo well but scale, and design solutions grounded in real sensor data and system constraints.

**Experience**
I work across the spectrum of 2D/3D perception: from classical CV to deep learning, using supervised, semi-, and unsupervised methods — chosen based on what *actually* works, not what's fashionable. I’ve designed full-stack perception systems for autonomy, from algorithm design to deployment.

I have experience in working with different sensors:

* RGB (pinhole, fisheye, wide-angle)
* Mono, NIR, LWIR
* Neuromorphic/event cameras
* LiDAR, IMU, multi-sensor fusion



**Current Role**
- Senior AI/ML Researcher, AI Part, Future Technology Research Institute, Deep In Sight, Korea.
- Working on ICMS, optimization and pipeline building.

**Previous Role**
- Group Lead, Automotive Perception — DeltaX.ai
- Led a team of 15+ engineers, building perception stacks for autonomous vehicles. Simultaneously pushing forward core research in AI-driven perception.

**Academic**
- I have completed my master's from the Department of IT Convergence Engineering (2019-2021) from Gachon University, under the supervision of  Prof. Yong Ju Jung. 
  - Applied research in depth, generative vision solutions, low-level vision, and sensor calibration.
- I have completed my undergraduate studies from the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (2013-2017), under the supervision of Dr. S. M. Mahbubur Rahman.

**Focus**
- **Now**: Classical CV-based methods, Optimization, Visual SLAM, C++, sensor fusion
- **Next**: MLOps/DevOps, LLMs and VLMs.
