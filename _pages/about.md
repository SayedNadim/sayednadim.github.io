Hi, I am Sayed Nadim.

I am a computer vision researcher with experience in developing cutting-edge AI-based solutions for autonomous vehicles, leading a mid-size team (12+ developers) and concurrently working as an AI researcher. I have experience in designing traditional/deep learning methods for 2D & 3D image processing techniques, utilizing supervised/semi-supervised/unsupervised learning, working with different sensors (RGB pinhole/wideangle/Fisheye cameras, Monochrome cameras, NIR/LWIR cameras, Neuromorphic sensors, LiDAR, IMU, etc.), and deep generative models.

I am currently working as a team lead and AI researcher in DeltaX.ai. Prior to that, I was working as a vision researcher in CVIP Lab, Gachon University, Republic of Korea.
