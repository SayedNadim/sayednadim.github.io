I am Sayed Nadim, and I am currently working as a Team Lead and AI Researcher in DeltaX.ai, Seoul, Korea. Prior to that, I used to work as a researcher at Computer Vision and Image Processing (CVIP) Lab, Gachon University. Since 2019, I have been working with generative image synthesis, stereo vision, and bio-inspired sensors. My current research interests lie in modeling visual perception systems, bio-inspired camera sensors, depth estimation, and multi-sensors data fusion.
