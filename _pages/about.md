I am Sayed Nadim and I am currently working as a researcher in Computer Vision and Image Processing (CVIP) Lab, Gachon University. I have been working with generative image synthesis, stereo vision, and bio-inspired sensors for three years. My current research interests lie in modeling visual perception systems, bio-inspired camera sensors, and multi-sensors data fusion. 

I have completed my master's from the Department of IT Convergence Engineering (2019-2021) from Gachon University, under the supervision of  Prof. Yong Ju Jung. I have completed my undergraduate studies from the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB) (2013-2017), under the supervision of Dr. S. M. Mahbubur Rahman.
