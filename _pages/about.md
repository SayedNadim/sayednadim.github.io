Intro
--
Hi, I am Sayed Nadim. I am a Computer vision researcher with a focus on practical, high-impact AI for autonomous systems. I work in R\&D and deliver PoCs/MVPs/design solutions grounded in real sensor data and system constraints. My focus is engineering AI systems that don’t collapse under real-world pressure.

Expertise
---
I work across the spectrum of 2D/3D perception: from classical CV to deep learning, using supervised, semi-, and unsupervised methods — chosen based on what *actually* works, not what's fashionable. I’ve designed full-stack perception systems for autonomy, from algorithm design to deployment.

I have experience in working with different sensors:

* RGB (pinhole, fisheye, wide-angle)
* Mono, NIR, LWIR
* Neuromorphic/event cameras
* LiDAR, IMU, multi-sensor fusion


Professional Affiliations
---
**Current Role**
- Senior AI/ML Researcher, AI Part, Future Technology Research Institute, Deep In Sight, Korea.
- Working on ICMS, optimization and pipeline building.

**Previous Role**
- Group Lead, Automotive Perception — DeltaX.ai
- Led a team of 15+ engineers, building perception stacks for autonomous vehicles. Simultaneously pushing forward core research in AI-driven perception.

Education
