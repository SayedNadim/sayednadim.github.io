I am *Sayed Nadim* and I am a computer vision researcher with 3+ years of experience in generative image synthesis, stereo vision and bio-inspired sensors. My current research interests lie in modeling visual perception systems, bio-inspired camera sensors, and multi-sensors data fusion.

I have completed my master's from the Department of IT Convergence Engineering (2019-2021) from Gachon University, under the supervision of  [Prof. Yong Ju Jung](https://sites.google.com/site/coolyjjung/). I have completed my undergraduate studies from the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from [University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB)](https://ulab.edu.bd/) (2013-2017), under the supervision of [Dr. S. M. Mahbubur Rahman](https://eee.buet.ac.bd/faculty/details/dr-s-m-mahbubur-rahman).  I am currently working as a researcher in [CVIP Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/gachoncvip/home), Gachon University.
